Use Google sheets as backend lol

Then we can host it statically?? 


The URL of the form
https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbwYrMYUdHhgfUC-jMoGzBE2lbz48oPVIsfnkrs1PAVP4ece8Qw/exec


Dude this is a GAMECHANGER....
We can log the adventures in cog biases results & analyze them??
Zomg lol

Maybe to make this more secure... should use a different gmail account?

hm... want to be able to hold down and spread money all over the screen
currently

want to animate the U.S. final budget
zoom out as it is allocating
make sure defense is visible

consider decreasing the number of depts?

TODO

put the div with mousedown/up events around the second section.

Can use urlParams to make it shareable...
So people can link to what they think the budget should be. 


hmm.... what to do about defense?? 
it doesn't fit on the screen.
may need to convert to SVG so we can zoom
http://www.petercollingridge.co.uk/tutorials/svg/interactive/pan-and-zoom/

log people's answers to google sheets

animate the final view
this could be a static SVG -- unclear if we want to reuse magic-bar or not

let's get this committed to github
