Use Google sheets as backend lol
https://medium.com/@dmccoy/how-to-submit-an-html-form-to-google-sheets-without-google-forms-b833952cc175

Then we can host it statically?? 


The URL of the form
https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbwYrMYUdHhgfUC-jMoGzBE2lbz48oPVIsfnkrs1PAVP4ece8Qw/exec


Dude this is a GAMECHANGER....
We can log the adventures in cog biases results & analyze them??
Zomg lol

Maybe to make this more secure... should use a different gmail account?

hm... want to be able to hold down and spread money all over the screen
currently

want to animate the U.S. final budget
zoom out as it is allocating
make sure defense is visible

consider decreasing the number of depts?

---
FINAL POLISH
Can use urlParams to make it shareable...
So people can link to what they think the budget should be. 

log people's answers to google sheets


---

TODO


bugs:
should block next button until all money is allocated
prevent going negative


---

USER TEST:

do we want to add descriptions of what the things do??

make the thing smaller -- it's currently too big and you can't see everything on the screen

should this be zoomable

probably want to user test this...
push this to github and see if it works on mobile


hmm.... what to do about defense?? 
it doesn't fit on the screen.
may need to convert to SVG so we can zoom
http://www.petercollingridge.co.uk/tutorials/svg/interactive/pan-and-zoom/


animate the final view
this could be a static SVG -- unclear if we want to reuse magic-bar or not
hm... this doesn't fit on one page
--

invalid arr bug is still happening
